"**Project Documentation**### Project Name: Face Detection### Code File: main.py#### Language: Python#### ![Python Logo](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png)### Complexity: involved## Overview:The main.py file is responsible for controlling the face detection process. It initializes the necessary modules and establishes a connection with the microcontroller if required. The code file plays a vital role in the overall project by enabling face detection functionality.## Dependencies:- helpers module- OpenCV library- Serial libraryTo install the dependencies, run the following commands:```bashpip install opencv-pythonpip install pyserial```## Usage:To use the code file, follow these steps:1. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.2. Import the main.py file into your project.3. Call the `init()` function with the appropriate parameters to initialize the face detection process.4. Optionally, you can pass the `write` parameter to establish a connection with the microcontroller.Example:```pythonfrom main import initargs = {  'write': True}init(args)```## Function Reference:### `init(args)`Description: Initializes the face detection process.Input Parameters:- `args` (dict): A dictionary containing the following parameters:  - `write` (bool): Indicates whether to establish a connection with the microcontroller.Return Value: NoneExample:```pythonargs = {  'write': True}init(args)```## Constants and Configuration:There are no constants or configuration variables used in the code file.## Sample Code Snippets:```pythonfrom main import initargs = {  'write': True}init(args)```## Unit Tests```pythondef test_init():  args = {    'write': True  }  init(args)  assert face_detecting == Falsetest_init()```## Tips and Best Practices:- Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before using the code file.- If you want to establish a connection with the microcontroller, set the `write` parameter to True when calling the `init()` function.## Troubleshooting:- If the face detection process is not starting, make sure the dependencies are installed correctly.- Check the connection with the microcontroller if the `write` parameter is set to True.## Contributing:To contribute to the code file, follow these steps:1. Fork the repository.2. Create a new branch for your changes.3. Make the necessary changes and commit them.4. Push your changes to your forked repository.5. Open a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.---# Code file:```pythonfrom helpers import serial_initdef init(args):    global uController    global face_detecting    uController = serial_init() if args['write'] else None    face_detecting = False  # write to uController only when detecting```> \"I have no special talent.
