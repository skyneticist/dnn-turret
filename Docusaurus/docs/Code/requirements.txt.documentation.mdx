"**Project Documentation**### Project Name: Code Analysis Tool### Code File: main.py#### Language: Python#### ![Python](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png) ### Complexity: Involved## Overview:The code file \"main.py\" is a Python script that serves as a code analysis tool. It is designed to analyze source code written in various programming languages and provide useful insights. This tool can help software engineers, technical writers, and developers gain a better understanding of their codebase, identify potential issues, and improve overall code quality. ## Dependencies:The following external libraries are required to run the code file:- numpy (version: 1.24.3)- pyserial (version: 3.5)- opencv-python (version: 4.7.0.72)To install the dependencies, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:```shellpip install numpy==1.24.3pip install pyserial==3.5pip install opencv-python==4.7.0.72```Make sure you have Python installed on your system before executing the above commands.## Usage:The code file \"main.py\" can be used by following these steps:1. Open a terminal or command prompt.2. Navigate to the directory where the \"main.py\" file is located.3. Run the command `python main.py` to execute the script.Upon execution, the code analysis tool will prompt you to enter the file path of the source code you want to analyze. After providing the path, the tool will process the code and generate a comprehensive analysis report.Here's an example usage of the code file:```shellpython main.pyEnter the file path: /path/to/source/code.py```## Function Reference:The \"main.py\" file contains the following functions:### Function Name: analyze_codeDescription: This function is the main entry point of the code analysis tool. It analyzes the provided source code file and generates a detailed report.Input Parameters:- file_path: A string representing the file path of the source code file.Return Value: NoneExample:```pythonanalyze_code(\"/path/to/source/code.py\")```## Constants and Configuration:The code file \"main.py\" does not contain any constants or configuration variables.## Sample Code Snippets:Here's a code snippet that demonstrates the usage of the code analysis tool:```pythonfrom main import analyze_codefile_path = \"/path/to/source/code.py\"analyze_code(file_path)```## Unit Tests:We have provided some basic unit tests for the `analyze_code` function. You can execute these tests by running the following command in the terminal:```shellpython -m unittest tests.py```Make sure you are in the same directory as the code file and the test file.## Tips and Best Practices:- Before using the code analysis tool, make sure you have installed all the required dependencies.- To obtain accurate results, provide the correct file path of the source code file you want to analyze.- Regularly update the dependencies to ensure you are using the latest versions.\"*The only way to do great work is to love what you do.*\" - Steve Jobs"
